I have a great idea, what do I need to set it up.

I need to write some business logic

I need to store some user data

I need to a way to access that data

I need a way to manage the data







- A database

- Some back end processing

- An API
- A way to serve my front end, any JS framework/ server combination



Everything is set in it's own container, front end back end yada yada yada but you don't need to build the containers yourself, prebuilt containers can handle that magic for you?
